## Slimer Timer: a childbirth labor contraction timer

Try an online demo: [mobile first contraction timer](http://greggles.github.io/slimertimer/).

This is a responsive, mobile first, single page app to help people who are 
in the process of childbirth. It will help measure the time, length, and
interval of contractions. Those 3 items are important elements in determining
when the baby will actually be born, when to go to a hospital/birthing center,
and probably some other stuff.

The page doesn't store or receive any information about the contractions. A 
goal is to maintain that privacy of information: you can download the file 
and place it on your own server if you want (it's just a single file with 
no images).

However, it should be possible to save and share the information (e.g. with a 
healthcare provider, with friends on social media, or for a "birth book").

## Contributions welcome

There are issues in the queue and I will certainly review any new ones or any
pull requests that arise. The goals/philosophy is laid out above though I might
be flexible on some of the philosophical points if there's a good reason.

## About me and the project
I'm a [Drupal developer](http://drupal.org/u/greggles) for the most part. Which 
means a lot of php and sql. For 2015 I decided to do "new-years resolutions" 
every month. January is to do more JavaScript and CSS. So, here it is. Some 
JavaScript. And CSS.
