## Slimer Timer: a childbirth labor contraction timer

Try an online demo: [mobile first contraction timer](http://greggles.github.io/slimertimer/).

This is a responsive, mobile first, single page app to help people who are
in the process of childbirth. It will help measure the time, length, and
interval of contractions. Those 3 items are important elements in determining
when the baby will actually be born, when to go to a hospital/birthing center,
and probably some other stuff.

### Privacy of your information
The page doesn't store or receive any information about the contractions. A
goal is to maintain that privacy of information: you can download the file
and place it on your own server if you want (it's just a single file with
no images).

### How you can privately share your own information
However, it is possible to save and share the information (e.g. with a
healthcare provider, with friends on social media, or for a "birth book").

Data is stored in the local storage of your browser AND in the url. If you want
to send your information to someone you can just copy the url and paste it
somewhere for sharing. There are also links at the bottom of the table that will
pre-fill forms for sending data via FaceBook, Twitter, or email.

You might also want to use this feature to transfer the url (from desktop to
phone, for example)

* [Here's a url with 2 contractions](http://greggles.github.io/slimertimer/#[{"startedTime":1422895375,"stoppedTime":1422895415},{"startedTime":1422895585,"stoppedTime":1422895645}]).

## Contributions welcome

There are issues in the queue and I will certainly review any new ones or any
pull requests that arise. The goals/philosophy should be laid out above though I
might be flexible on some of the philosophical points if there's a good reason.

## About me and the project
I'm a [Drupal developer](http://drupal.org/u/greggles) for the most part. Which
means a lot of php and sql. For 2015 I decided to do "new-years resolutions"
every month. January is to do more JavaScript and CSS. So, here it is. Some
JavaScript. And CSS. In January.
